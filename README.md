## CHESS GAME ‚ôüÔ∏è
***
First code project in React before starting to learn the code through training  üíª
<br><br>
## OBJECTIF üéØ
***
* Completely redo the application with a back in Node.js and a front React with my current technical knowledge.
<br><br>
* Compare the current code (not at all factored, first step in development) with the new application to constantly improve myself
<br><br>
* Develop the feature "Play against the computer" with a single level of difficulty (or more!)
<br><br>
* Game recording & pawn movement history for game analysis
<br><br>

## USE THIS APP 
***
Try the [Chess Game](https://chess-amelie.netlify.app/) online. <br><br>
You need to be 2 players or to play both colors yourself.<br><br>
The option to play with the computer or the history of your games will soon be available.
<br><br>
To use locally, git clone this repository, then npm install then npm start. 

Have a good Game &#129321;
